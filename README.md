## <a name="why"></a>Why? 👽
I think that Fibonacci it's very interesting, and it's a great opportunity to practice C++!

## <a name="whatItDoes"></a>What it does? 🚩
It **generates all the Fibonacci numbers between 0 and the input you give it**, and then **calculate the golden ratio** with the latests values in the sequence that were calculated.

You could also pass `0` to calculate Fibonacci numbers in a loop, but the results won't be good when the integer turns too big.

## <a name="building"></a>Building 🧑‍🚀
In order to build this, you have to go to the project directory and build it with `make build`, this should generate a binary called fibonacci by default.
And it's built! 🎉
